# C ++ Access Time Test

## Array vs Vector Access time

This code experiment will test the access time between a STL Vector and Array found in C++. We will loop 10,000,000 times accessing the same variable in both data structure. Using the time.h library, we can take the difference in time and compare appropretly.
