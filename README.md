# C ++ Access Time Test

This code experiment will test the access time between a STL Vector and Array found in C++. We will loop 10,000,000 times accessing the same variable in both data structure. Using the time.h library, we can take the difference in time and compare appropriately.

## conclusion
we can see by the image provided that Arrays have a faster access time than Vectors.
